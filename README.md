# Word Dictionaries
Repository for doing random things with language word dictionaries

# Data
- [English Word List](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
- You can also use the linux dictionaries in `/usr/share/dict/` or `/usr/dict/`
	- [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_(Unix))

# TODO List:
- Read all words
- Do cool things with them:
	- Statistics
	- Get words with only a set of letters/chars
	- Word connections (distance = chardiff^2)
	- Typewriting game?
